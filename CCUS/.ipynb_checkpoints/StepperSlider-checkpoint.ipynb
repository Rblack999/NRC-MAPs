    "This notebook allows the user to control the stepper slider which the cell is mounted to. The user can manually input the desired displacement of the stepper slider for testing, along with the speed and the axis (G0) by running the appropriate cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to communicate with the board used (BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3), we use G code commands. For our purposes as the stepper slider moves on the same axis (up and down), G0 X-- F## is the typical command used. Here, -- represents the displacement in milimeters and ## represents the speed of the steper slder. The stepper slider uses relative displacemetn by default and negative X value represents down and vice versa for positive displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "List of Relevant commands:\n",
    "- $H:return to reference (home) position \n",
    "- ?: to get the state of the board as well as the position\n",
    "- G90: switch to absolute displacement (from the home position which is X = 25) this is the original setting\n",
    "- G91: switch to relative displacement (reltive to the last position the stepper slider is\n",
    "- A full list can be found in this website: https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/cnc-machining/g-code.html.\n",
